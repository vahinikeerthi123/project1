A paragraph is a group of related sentences that discuss a single main idea. It typically consists of a topic sentence, which introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on it, and a concluding sentence that summarizes the point.
To write effective paragraphs, consider the following:
Unity: Ensure all sentences relate to the main idea.
Coherence: Use transitions to connect ideas smoothly.
Development: Provide enough detail and examples to support the main idea. 
2
Length: Aim for at least three sentences, but vary length based on content and purpose.
